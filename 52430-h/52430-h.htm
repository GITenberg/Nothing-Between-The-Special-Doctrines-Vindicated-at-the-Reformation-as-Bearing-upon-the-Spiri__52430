<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE
SPECIAL DOCTRINES OF THE REFORMATION AS BEARING UPON THE
SPIRITUAL LIFE OF THE CHURCH.</h2>
<p>It is a glorious subject that your Committee has entrusted to
my care, and I consider it no small privilege to have been led by
your invitation to study it.&nbsp; At the same time it is not
without its almost overwhelming difficulty, for our conflict with
Rome extends along the whole line of truth, so that almost the
whole of Christianity is included in the special doctrines of the
Reformation.&nbsp; The struggle is between Christianity
paganized, and Christianity pure; and the real conflict lies
between the whole system of the one, and the whole system of the
other.&nbsp; It reminds me of a conversation between a Protestant
clergyman and a Romish priest.&nbsp; The clergyman, in order to
illustrate the spirit in which Christian brethren should hide
each other&rsquo;s faults, told a story of an artist who, in
painting the Emperor of Russia, put the finger to the face in the
attitude of thoughtfulness, and so concealed an unsightly
blemish, on which the Romish priest said, &ldquo;And why do you
not do the same towards us?&rdquo;&nbsp; To which his friend
replied, &ldquo;We would if we could; but we cannot; for in your
case it is blot all over.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the taint is all over
the teaching of Rome.</p>
<p>Yet there is one class of subjects in which our conflict with
Rome is more especially prominent, viz., that which concerns the
application of the great salvation to the individual.&nbsp; That
salvation may be compared to a chain reaching down from
heaven.&nbsp; Respecting the higher links, such as the nature of
God, the doctrine of the Trinity, the divinity of the Son, the
humanity and the purpose of his death, there is no direct
collision between us; but when we come down to the last link of
all, the application of the whole work to the sinner, it is then
that the real battle rages.&nbsp; The great struggle of the
Reformation was a <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>struggle between the divine application and the human;
between the simple principle of gift as revealed by God himself,
and the man-made system of merit as constructed by the Church of
Rome.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point let us study four particulars, which
may be likened to the four corner stones of our citadel, and
consider them in the order in which they stand in our Articles;
the sufficiency of the Scriptures; justification by faith; the
spirituality of the sacraments; and the final completeness of the
one propitiation.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>(1.)&mdash;<i>The Sufficiency of the Scriptures</i>.</p>
<p>It is the fashion to say that the Articles were intended as a
compromise; but that nothing can be further from the fact may, I
believe, be proved without the slightest difficulty.&nbsp; The
Council of Trent met in the year <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1546, and then drew up some of its
most stringent dogmatical decrees.&nbsp; It was in direct
opposition to these decrees that the Articles were framed six
years afterwards, as containing the clear, well-considered, and
uncompromising testimony of the Church of England.&nbsp; This may
be proved even by their omissions, for there are some things
which we might wish to find in them, but which have been passed
over in silence, for the simple reason that respecting them there
was no collision with Rome.&nbsp; Such, <i>e.g.</i>, is the
inspiration of the Scriptures.&nbsp; If we were called to draw up
the Article now, the subject of inspiration would be the first to
be considered.&nbsp; But no error had been taught by Rome
respecting it, and therefore it did not appear on the
battlefield, and was not mentioned in the Article.&nbsp; The
Article referred only to the new position defined by Rome in the
Council of Trent, and that new position involved the
insufficiency of the Scriptures.&nbsp; Rome taught two errors,
first, that there are two parallel lines of truth, &ldquo;written
Scripture and unwritten tradition,&rdquo; and declared that both
must be received &ldquo;with equal sense of piety and
reverence&rdquo;; and second, Rome placed the Church as an
interpreter between the Scriptures and the individual, and
decreed that no one should &ldquo;dare to interpret the
Scriptures except according as the holy Mother Church <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>has held, and
still holds, and also according to the unanimous consent of the
fathers, even though their interpretations should never at any
time have been brought to light.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in direct
opposition to this decree that the Sixth Article on the
Sufficiency of the Scriptures was drawn up six years
afterwards.&nbsp; It declared Scripture to be sufficiently full
and sufficiently clear: sufficiently full, for it contains all
things necessary to salvation without any supplement from
tradition; and sufficiently clear, for, without the aid of either
Church authority or the unanimous consent of the fathers, it
speaks right home to the heart and understanding, so that
whatever &ldquo;is not read therein, or may be proved thereby, is
not to be required of any man that it should be believed as an
Article of the faith.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>(2.)&mdash;<i>Justification by Faith Alone</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should man be justified with God?&rdquo; has always
been the first grand question for an awakened conscience.&nbsp;
Thus those who know what it is to be justified through faith,
will not be surprised at Luther&rsquo;s memorable statement that
the doctrine of justification by faith is the test of a standing
or falling church, for we all know that in the case of
individuals it is the turning point between a life of fear and a
life of peace; may I not add between even death and life
itself?&nbsp; Now on this point we are in direct collision with
Rome.&nbsp; The conflict turns upon a single word.&nbsp; How can
it be of such overwhelming importance, some will say, if all
turns upon a word?&nbsp; But one word may make all the difference
between truth and error, between peace and anxiety.&nbsp; There
was a time when the whole controversy respecting the divinity of
our Blessed Saviour turned on a letter, the little letter
<i>&iota;</i> in the word
&#8009;&mu;&omicron;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&#943;&alpha;,
which made all the difference between oneness and
resemblance.&nbsp; The turning point in this controversy is the
one word &ldquo;only.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1546 Rome decreed &ldquo;if
any man shall say that men are justified by the imputation of the
righteousness of Christ <i>only</i>, or the remission of our sins
<i>only</i>, and not by grace and charity, which is infused it
their hearts by the Holy Scriptures, and is inherent in them, let
him be anathema.&rdquo;&nbsp; That anathema the Church of England
boldly challenged when in <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1552
she drew up her Articles; <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and with distinct reforms to the
&ldquo;<i>only</i>&rdquo; of Rome&rsquo;s decree, she said
exactly that on which Rome had pronounced her anathema, &ldquo;we
are accounted righteous before God <i>only</i> for the merit of
our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;we are
justified by faith <i>only</i>, is a most wholesome
doctrine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such an Article does not look like a
compromise.&nbsp; It was the direct and open acceptance of
Rome&rsquo;s challenge.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any man says <i>only</i>,
let him be anathema,&rdquo; says Rome.&nbsp; We say it, says the
Church of England, for we know it to be the truth of God, and,
knowing that, we defy your curse.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>(3.)&mdash;<i>The Spirituality of the Sacraments</i>.</p>
<p>I am often surprised that staunch Protestants appear sometimes
to speak with a certain measure of distrust of the Church
Catechism, for there are few documents which contain clearer, or
more decisive, statements as to great Protestant
principles.&nbsp; What, <i>e.g.</i>, can be clearer than the
definition given of a sacrament, &ldquo;An outward and visible
sign of an inward and spiritual grace&rdquo;?&nbsp; That
definition teaches two truths&mdash;(1) That the grace is inward
and spiritual, and (2) That the sign is distinct from it, being
outward and visible.&nbsp; In that short sentence is contained
one of the great principles of the reformation.&nbsp; Rome had
confused the sign with the grace when it decreed that the whole
substance of the elements was changed into the whole substance of
the body and blood of Christ, in which case it is obvious the
sign must cease to be a sign, being changed into the thing
signified.&nbsp; The Church of England taught, Article 28, that
such &ldquo;transubstantiation was repugnant to the plain words
of Scripture, and overthroweth the nature of a
sacrament.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rome had decreed, &ldquo;If any one shall
say that in the Eucharist Christ is received <i>only</i>
spiritually (observe the <i>only</i>), let him be
anathema.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Church of England replied, &ldquo;The
body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the supper
<i>only</i> after an heavenly and spiritual manner.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Rome said, &ldquo;If any one shall say that faith <i>alone</i> is
a sufficient preparation for receiving the Lord&rsquo;s Supper,
let him be anathema.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Church of England replied,
&ldquo;The mean,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, the only mean &ldquo;whereby
the Body of Christ is received and eaten <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>in the supper,
is faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pages of other passages might be quoted
had I time, but these are enough to show the real point at
issue.&nbsp; Rome taught that the sign was transubstantiated into
the thing signified, and so ceased to be a sign as it became a
living Saviour, localised on the altar with body, soul, and even
bones and nerves.&nbsp; The Church of England taught that the
risen Lord is &ldquo;in heaven and not here,&rdquo; that the sign
remains a material, visible sign, and that the grace is a
spiritual grace.&nbsp; So that, as is well said in the homily,
&ldquo;The meat we seek for in this supper is spiritual food; and
nourishment of our soul, a heavenly refection, and not earthly;
an invisible meat and not carnal.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again,
&ldquo;Look up with faith upon the body and blood of thy God,
thou marvel with reverence, thou touch it with the mind, then
receive it with the hand of thine heart, and thou take it fully
with thy inward man.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>(4.)&mdash;<i>The Final Completeness of the one
Propitiation</i>.</p>
<p>We hear a great deal in modern times of the mass.&nbsp; The
Church of England calls the holy sacrament &ldquo;the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper or Holy Communion.&rdquo;&nbsp; But some
faithless sons of hers call it &ldquo;the mass,&rdquo; and some
amiable men are so enamoured of visible unity that they actually
memorialize the Archbishop for a recognized toleration of all the
paraphernalia of what the Reformers used to call &ldquo;massing
priests.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now let us clearly understand what is the
real point of the controversy respecting the mass.&nbsp; It is
associated in people&rsquo;s minds with the Eastward position,
and with candles, with incense, with chasubles and tunicles, with
thurifers, acolytes, and priests, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp;
But it was not for such things as these that our martyrs
died.&nbsp; They are all bad enough, but in themselves they were
not worth dying for.&nbsp; They died for a truth, and the great
truth for which they died was the complete, final, everlasting
sufficiency of the one Divine Sacrifice for sin.&nbsp; It was
this that put the Church of Rome and the Church of England into
direct and irreconcilable antagonism.&nbsp; It was not till the
year <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1562 that Rome drew up
her decrees on this subject, so that in this instance England was
first.&nbsp; Our Reformers were well acquainted with all that was
being taught by Rome, and so drew up the noble and uncompromising
words of article xxxi. in <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the year <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1552:&mdash;&ldquo;The offering of
Christ <i>once</i> made is that perfect redemption, propitiation,
and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world, both
original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin
but that <i>alone</i>.&nbsp; Wherefore the sacrifices of masses,
in the which, it was commonly said, that the priest did offer
Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain or
guilt, were blasphemous fables and dangerous
deceits.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well spoken words were those, burning words
from glowing hearts.&nbsp; Those men knew the value of a
finished, complete, all-sufficient, and final propitiation by the
Son of God, and their trumpets gave no uncertain sound as they
swept to the winds the man-made fiction of a propitiatory
sacrifice in the mass.&nbsp; And it was in direct opposition to
these noble words that Rome decreed, &ldquo;If any man shall say
that the sacrifice of the mass is not propitiatory, and ought not
to be offered for the living and the dead, for sins, punishments,
satisfaction, and other necessities, let him be anathema;&rdquo;
(Sep. xxii.&ndash;3), and thereby taught that there was a
necessity for some further propitiatory sacrifice; and that the
remission of sin is not granted, as England had declared it was,
through the one complete, final, and all-sufficient propitiation
and that alone; but that for the remission of sins and
punishments there is required a continuation of sacrifice in the
mass.</p>
<p>It would be a very easy thing to shew how all the other
fictions of Rome must melt away if these four great truths are
established in the heart.&nbsp; Let them be known in their power,
and all the rest, mariolatry, saint worship, purgatory, priestly
absolution as a means of forgiveness of sin, and all the
complicated network of superstition will disappear of themselves;
but for that I have no time now, for I must hasten to that which
seems to be the great object of the Committee in the selection of
the subject, the practical bearing of these blessed truths on the
spiritual life of all classes in the Church.&nbsp; What, then, is
that practical bearing of these great and most important
principles?&nbsp; Is it possible to gather them together, as it
were, into one focus and to sum up the result in one simple
proposition?&nbsp; I believe it is, and that the practical result
of the whole matter it this, that on these distinctive principles
we are brought face <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>to face with God himself, and that there is nothing
intermediate between God and the sinner, so that the whole result
may be summed up in two very simple words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing
between.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observe for a few moments how this result follows from every
one of the four points.</p>
<p>Are we earnestly desiring truth? and do we long to know the
revelation of God respecting the way of life?&nbsp; We are not
called to search for it in that vast bundle of hay, the unanimous
consent of the fathers, or to apply to a priest to convey to us
an authoritative interpretation even of passages which the Church
has never interpreted, but we are taught to go straight to the
fountain-head of truth at it wells up from God himself, and as He
has given it in His own inspired Word.&nbsp; We are not dependent
on what man tells us of God&rsquo;s revelation, but we go direct
to the revelation itself.&nbsp; We do not rely on any
intermediate authority who may discolour the truth as a painted
window discolours the sunbeam, but we look straight at the truth
itself in all its brilliant purity, and, though sometimes we may
be dazzled by its brilliancy, we rejoice in the fact that there
is <i>nothing between</i>.</p>
<p>Are we anxious on the subject of our acceptance with God? and
asking the question, How can a man be justified with God?&nbsp;
We are again brought face to face with Himself.&nbsp; We are not
called to look <i>outside</i> for any sacerdotal act to introduce
us to God, or even <i>inside</i> for any work of the Holy Spirit
in our own hearts to recommend us to His mercy.&nbsp; But without
strength, without godliness, sinners, and even enemies, we are
permitted in His boundless mercy to receive the reconciliation,
to throw ourselves, with <i>nothing between</i>, into the arms of
Him who has redeemed us, and as we are, and just as we are, trust
Him at once for a full, complete, and all-sufficient
justification before God.</p>
<p>Are we longing to live feeding on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
nourished by that which in the sixth chapter of St. John he
sometime describes as the bread of life, and sometimes as his
body and blood?&nbsp; Again we are taught that for that sacred
food and sustenance we must be brought into direct and immediate
contact with himself.&nbsp; We are not to look for any mystical
change in the elements supposed to be accomplished by <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>some
miraculous power in a priest, or suppose that it is Christ in the
elements that is the real food of the soul when hungering and
thirsting after life.&nbsp; But we are taught that it is the soul
<i>itself</i> that feeds on Christ <i>himself</i>, and so enjoys
his promise, &ldquo;He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and
he that believeth in me shall never thirst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And lastly, does the soul tremble under the consciousness of
sin?&nbsp; Sin of the nature?&nbsp; Sin of the heart?&nbsp; Sin
of the thought?&nbsp; Sin of the act?&nbsp; Sin of the whole man
and every part of him?&nbsp; Does the horrid, dreadful thought of
sin rise up as an impassable barrier between the
conscience-stricken sinner and the holiness of God?&nbsp; Once
more the great principle of a complete and final propitiation
proclaims without reserve the joyful tidings that in Christ Jesus
there is <i>nothing between</i>, that the veil of the temple is
rent from the top to the bottom, and that now there stands open a
new and living way leading direct to the mercy seat of God.&nbsp;
To remove that awful barrier of unforgiven sin, we need no
saints, no masses, no purgatorial fire.&nbsp; We need no priests
to make a propitiatory offering by what he claims as his
sacerdotal power.&nbsp; As believers in the Lord Jesus Christ we
have received the reconciliation from the Son of God
himself.&nbsp; It is his own blood that was shed, and his own
hand that has given the pardon.&nbsp; And, though Satan may
accuse, and conscience convict, though it may seem impossible to
our own judgment that such as we are should ever be permitted to
find fellowship with God, we may thank him with profound
thanksgiving that he has removed the curse by bearing it himself
upon the cross, and may venture to draw near in the words of that
most incomparable hymn&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as I am, thy love unknown<br />
Has broken every barrier down,<br />
Now to be thine, and thine alone,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
O Lamb of God, I come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever, then, we take as our starting point, we are brought
to the same conclusion.&nbsp; NOTHING BETWEEN.&nbsp; From
whichever point of the compass we begin, whether from the
Scriptures, or justification, or the spirituality of the
sacrament, or the full and finished Atonement, in every case we
are led to the same <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>conclusion.&nbsp; Everything intermediate between the
Soul and the Saviour is swept away for ever, and with nothing
between&mdash;nothing to hide the truth while claiming to make it
plain, or to hinder the approach while pretending to help
it&mdash;we are brought face to face with the Lord Jesus Christ
himself; and being pardoned through his perfect propitiation, and
accepted in his perfect righteousness, we can say as St. John
did, &ldquo;Truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His
Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
